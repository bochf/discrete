## Relations
### 1. 
Let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be relations on $\lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$ given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
&R_1= \lbrace (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2) \rbrace\\
&R_2= \lbrace (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 4), (2, 2) \rbrace\\
\end{aligned}
$$

List the elements of $R_2 \circ R_1$ and $R_1 \circ R_2$.

## Equivalence Relations
### 2. 
Determine whether the given relation is an equivalence relation on $X= \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \rbrace$. If the relation is an equivalence relation, list the equivalence classes.

$$R= \lbrace (x,y) \in X \times X | 3 divids (x-y) \rbrace$$

### 3. 
List the ordered pairs of the equivalence relation R on the set $X= \lbrace 1,2,3,4 \rbrace$ defined by the parition $F= \lbrace\lbrace 1,4 \rbrace,\lbrace 2,3 \rbrace\rbrace$. Also, find the equivalence classes [1], [2], [3], and [4].

### 4. 
Let $f$ be a function from $X$ to $Y$. Define a relation $R$ on $X$ by
$xRy$ if and only if $f(x)=f(y)$
Prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $X$.

## Matrices of Relations
### 5. 
Suppose $X=\lbrace 1,2,3 \rbrace$ and $Y=\lbrace x,y \rbrace$, and $Z=\lbrace a,b,c \rbrace$ are ordered sets. If $R_1$ is the relation from $X$ to $Y$ given by

$$R_1=\lbrace(1,x), (1,y), (2,x), (3,x) \rbrace$$

and $R_2$ is the relation from $Y$ to $Z$ given by

$$R_2=\lbrace (x,b), (y,b), (y,a), (y,c) \rbrace$$

(a) Find the matrix $A_1$ of the relation R1 (relative to the given orderings).  
(b) Find the matrix $A_2$ of the relation R2 (relative to the given orderings).  
(c) Find the matrix product $A_1A_2$.  
(d) Use the result of part ($c$) to find the matrix of the relation $R_2 \circ R_1$.  
(e) Use the result of part ($d$) to find the relation $R_2 \circ R_1$ (as a set of ordered pairs).

### 6.
Suppose the matrix $A$ of a relation $R$ on an ordered set $X=\lbrace w,x,y,z \rbrace$ is given by

$$
A=
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1&0&1&0\\
0&0&0&0\\
1&0&1&0\\
0&0&0&1\\
\end{array}
\right)
$$

(a) Use $A$ to determine if $R$ is reflexive.  
(b) Use $A$ to determine if $R$ is symmetric.  
(c) Use $A$ to determine if $R$ is anti-symmetric.  
(d) Use $A$ to determine if $R$ is transitive.  
(e) Find $R$ as a set of ordered pairs.  
(f) Find $R$ as a digraph.
